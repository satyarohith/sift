# Sift

Sift is a routing and utility library for Deno and
[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

[![deno doc](https://doc.deno.land/badge.svg)](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/sift@0.5.0/mod.ts)

## Usage

The documentation below briefly explains the common usage of the functions. You
can visit [deno doc](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/sift@0.5.0/mod.ts)
site to learn more about the API.

```sh
deno run -A script.ts
```

### `serve()`

`serve()` is the routing function. It accepts an object literal with path
strings as keys and their corresponding route handlers as values. The path
string is processed using
[URLPattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) and
when the requested path matches the provided pattern, the corresponding handler
is invoked.

```js
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/x/sift@0.5.0/mod.ts";

serve({
  "/": () => new Response("hello world"),
  "/blog/:slug": (request, params) => {
    const post = `Hello, you visited ${params.slug}!`;
    return new Response(post);
  },
  // The route handler of 404 will be invoked when a route handler
  // for the requested path is not found.
  404: () => new Response("not found"),
});
```

### `serveStatic()`

Serve static files relative to your source code.

> Note: Your project should have a git repository linked when using Deno Deploy.

By default, up to 20 static assets that are less than 10MB are cached. You can
disable caching by setting `cache: false` in the options object.

If you're serving a directory, it is required that the path string end with
`:filename+` as serveStatic uses this param to construct the absolute URL to the
requested resource.

```js
import { serve, serveStatic } from "https://deno.land/x/sift@0.5.0/mod.ts";

serve({
  // You can serve a single file.
  "/": serveStatic("public/index.html", { baseUrl: import.meta.url }),
  // Or a directory of files.
  "/:filename+": serveStatic("public", { baseUrl: import.meta.url }),
  // You can modify the fetched response before returning to the request
  // by using the intervene option.
  "/style.css": serveStatic("style.css", {
    baseUrl: import.meta.url,
    // The intervene function is called after the resource is
    // fetched from the source URL. The original request and the
    // fetched response are passed as arguments and a response
    // is expected from the function.
    intervene: (request, response) => {
      // Do some processing to the response.
      return response;
    },
  }),
});
```

### `json()`

Converts an object literal to a JSON string and creates a `Response` instance
with `application/json` as the `content-type`.

```js
import { json, serve } from "https://deno.land/x/sift@0.5.0/mod.ts";

serve({
  "/": () => json({ message: "hello world" }),
  "api/create": () => json({ message: "created" }, { status: 201 }),
});
```

### `jsx()`

Renders JSX components to HTML string and creates a `Response` instance with
`text/html` as the `content-type`.

When using this function, it is important that your file extension is `.jsx` or
`.tsx` for Deno Deploy to transform you code and you've the `h` function
imported.

```jsx
/** @jsx h */
import { h, jsx, serve } from "https://deno.land/x/sift@0.5.0/mod.ts";

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </div>
);

const NotFound = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Page not found</h1>
  </div>
);

serve({
  "/": () => jsx(<App />),
  404: () => jsx(<NotFound />, { status: 404 }),
});
```
